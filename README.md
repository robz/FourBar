Linkages
========

I started this project in order to simulate linkages. I wrote my own four-bar and five-bar linkage simulator so that I could easily mess with optimization and real-time tweaking.

See examples of four-bars: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rjnevels/Linkages/fourbar/examples/
and examples of five-bars: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rjnevels/Linkages/fivebar/examples/

I've also started trying to make a linkage "font" where each letter of the alphabet is traced out by a linkage mechanism. You can see that here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rjnevels/Linkages/fivebar/examples/RAS.html
